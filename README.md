# Modern Day Philosopher

## Introduction
This group project was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. We were required to create an interactive website that used at least two server-side APIs and met all of the acceptance criteria (see Acceptance Criteria below).

All code was written from scratch.
