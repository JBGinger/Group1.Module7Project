# Modern Day Philosopher

## Introduction
Have you ever wondered who would win in a battle between two of the greatest philosophers of our time?

Oh, you were thinking Kanye West and Ron Swanson? Well us too! Have no worries because we have created the solution. We developed this site for our two modern day philosophers to battle it out for bragging rights.

## Description
This group project was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. We were required to create an interactive website that used at least two server-side APIs and met all of the acceptance criteria (see Acceptance Criteria below).

All code was written from scratch.

## Installation
No installation required (see Deployed below).

## Project Insight
* Darnell: Our primary challenge in this project was coordinating the efforts of our group members in a productive way. When planning the project, we had to collaborate to come up with ideas that fulfilled the project requirements, and were doable. We also ran into significant trouble figuring out how to manage the work of three people on the same GitHub repository.

* Jeff: This project challenged me (and I suspect the others in my group) in a way that was unique when compared to our normal weekly assignments. Most notably - I learned that I did not understand GitHub nearly as well as I thought I did. The process of creating individual branches for each group member and merging them coherently was trickier than expected. In addition to these difficulties, this project required that I learn a new CSS framework (I chose one called "Foundation") besides bootstrap. Unfortunately, Foundation proved to be less intiutive than I had hoped it would be, and I had significant difficulty getting the page elements to display properly at first.

* Peter: The process of multiple people working indiviually and on the same project was a new problem to deal with and in my opinion was one of the more, if not the most, difficult parts of the project. When working with my partners after we started sharing the changes we'd made I realized we all think about the process of the development differently and we all code a little differently. That was just a new process to get adjusted to.
