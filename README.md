## Description
This group project was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. We were required to create an interactive website that used at least two server-side APIs and met all of the acceptance criteria (see Acceptance Criteria below).

All code was written from scratch.

## Installation
No installation required (see Deployed below).

## Project Insight
* Darell:

* Jeff:

* Peter: The process of multiple people working indiviually and on the same project was a new problem to deal with and in my opinion was one of the more, if not the most, difficult parts of the project. When working with my partners after we started sharing the changes we'd made I realized we all think about the process of the development differently and we all code a little differently. That was just a new process to get adjusted to.
